    <h1> This is my project for PLTW 1.1.9!! My partner, Chloe Chaiyakul, and I made a duck pond. We have multiple animals that move around, including two turtles and a duck. We used custom stamps to create the animals in our project. I included two photos of the code. The top code is explaining the movement of the duck, and the second code is a custom shape of an oval. Thank you!</h1>

    <h1> This is my project for 1.2.5 </h1>
    <h1> The game is Spongebob vs. Patrick Fireball. </h1>
    <h1> How to play: move Spongebob and Patrick up and down using the “w and  s” keys for Spongebob and the up and down arrow keys for Patrick. Each character has fire balls that they shoot at the opposing character. When one player has been shot 3 times, they are dead. A screen saying who won will appear right after. Everytime a character has been shot, their life counter will reduce by one. </h1>

    <h1> This is our scratch project. We chose to a clicker game and our theme is animals. Each animal gives you something different when you click on it. You start by clicking the chick (code is the first image on the left)and you will gain one point per click. Once you have enough points, you can click on the elephant (middle image code), which will give you one automatic point per second each time you click the sprite. Then, you will be able to afford the dog (right image), and the dog can give you two automatic points per second. Your points will continue to grow and you will eventually break the high score! </h1>

    <h1> This is my 3.1.6 PLTW Project </h1>
    <h1> We decided that the data given to us was represening the environment of the Rocky Mountains </h1>

    <h1> Based on the requirments for each environment, these are our interpretations of the graphs before we saw the real ones on the spreadsheet. </h1>

    <h1> The description of low temperatures that heat up quickly during the day time match with the data set and graph we presented (top left). The low constant howl of the wind matches with the staggering, but incredibly low data readings and low decimal data points of the graph on the top right. The constant winds that vary with intensity matches our graph on the bottom left along with our data set that shows a constant line that varies intensely within a small range. Lastly, the bright light during the day inter upted by clouds shows similar pattern to our graph at the bottom right, with bright light readings taking a dip for a short period of time which represents the passing clouds. Rocky Mountains is what we’ve concluded is the environment the rover took readings from. </h1>

    <h1> This is my 3.2.4 PLTW Project </h1>

    <h1> The project was based on the US data about honey production. My partner and I were able to make graphs using python where it showed the large, medium, and small honey productions in the United States. As well as total honey production in all the states and the average honey production in the states.
