    <h1> This is my project for PLTW 1.1.9!! My partner, Chloe Chaiyakul, and I made a duck pond. We have multiple animals that move around, including two turtles and a duck. We used custom stamps to create the animals in our project. I included two photos of the code. The top code is explaining the movement of the duck, and the second code is a custom shape of an oval. Thank you!</h1>

    <h1> This is my project for 1.2.5 </h1>
    <h1> The game is spongebob vs. patrick fireball. </h1>
    <h1> How to play: move spongebob and patrick up and down using the “w and  s” keys for spongebob and the up and down arrow keys for Patrick. Each character has fire balls that they shoot at the opposing character. When one player has been shot 3 times, they are dead. A screen saying who won will appear right after. Everytime a character has been shot, their life counter will reduce by one. </h1>
